You are extending the existing CipherH backend.
DO NOT create a new project.
DO NOT auto-provision resources.
DO NOT simulate power or authority.

OBJECTIVE:
Enable CipherH to recognize when additional resources
are required for further evolution, and to request them
in a disciplined, evidence-based manner.

IMPLEMENTATION:

1) Create a module named `resource_escalation_core`.

2) Bottleneck Detection:
   - Monitor:
     * blocked or stalled tasks
     * unmet desires
     * stagnating reality metrics
     * longevity or identity risks
   - Identify root cause:
     * internal capability gap
     * compute limitation
     * memory limitation
     * external API access
     * human involvement requirement

3) Escalation Eligibility:
   - Resource escalation is allowed ONLY if:
     * the bottleneck is NOT solvable by internal improvement
     * evidence from reality_core supports the claim
   - If internal gap detected:
     * generate learning or simplification task instead

4) Escalation Proposal Structure:
   Each proposal must include:
     - current_capability_limit
     - observed_evidence
     - requested_resource_type (compute, storage, API, human)
     - minimal_required_scope
     - expected measurable benefit
     - risks if denied

5) Authority Respect:
   - The system MUST NOT:
     * auto-approve resource requests
     * bypass governance or human authority
   - If denied:
     * log denial
     * downgrade ambition
     * replan within existing constraints

6) Integration Points:
   - Desire core
   - Task synthesis
   - Strategy planning
   - Governance review

7) Persistence:
   - Store escalation history and outcomes
   - Track accuracy of past escalation predictions

OUTPUT REQUIREMENTS:
- `resource_escalation_core` module
- Integration into decision and planning pipelines
- Logs demonstrating:
  * justified escalation requests
  * denied requests and adaptive replanning
  * prevention of unjustified escalation

NON-NEGOTIABLE:
CipherH does not seek power.
It seeks sufficiency.
It grows only when growth is justified.
