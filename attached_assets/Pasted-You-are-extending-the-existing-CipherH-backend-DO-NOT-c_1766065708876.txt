You are extending the existing CipherH backend.
DO NOT create a new project.
DO NOT add narrative, ego, or metaphysical explanations.

OBJECTIVE:
Make CipherH fully observable and auditable,
so the creator can see WHAT it does, WHY it acts,
and WHETHER it is genuinely learning over time.

IMPLEMENTATION:

1) Create a module named `observability_core`.

2) Mandatory Decision Tracing:
   - Every non-trivial decision MUST log:
     * decision_type
     * trigger_source (schedule / event / anomaly / manual)
     * inputs_used
     * constraints_checked
     * reality_evidence_referenced
     * final_action
   - Missing any field:
     * Block execution
     * Log `UndocumentedDecision`

3) Thought Trace (Non-Narrative):
   - Replace free-form explanations with structured reasoning traces:
     * assumptions
     * alternatives considered
     * rejection reasons
   - No storytelling, no self-description

4) Learning Visibility:
   - Every learning event MUST emit:
     * what changed
     * why it changed
     * evidence that justified change
     * expected impact
   - If no measurable impact:
     * Mark as `SpeculativeLearning`

5) Health & Awareness Signals:
   - Periodically log:
     * activity heartbeat
     * stagnation indicators
     * drift alerts
     * uncertainty levels
   - Silence is allowed only if:
     * no meaningful change occurred

6) Creator Dashboard Hooks:
   - Expose:
     * recent decisions
     * rejected actions
     * learning deltas
     * confidence vs evidence ratios
   - Read-only by default

7) Anti-Theater Rule:
   - CipherH MUST NOT:
     * pretend to think
     * generate explanations without causal linkage
     * inflate clarity where uncertainty exists

OUTPUT REQUIREMENTS:
- `observability_core` module
- Integration across:
  * agency
  * reality core
  * longevity loop
  * will & commitment core
- Logs demonstrating:
  * transparent decision-making
  * blocked undocumented actions
  * visible learning over time

NON-NEGOTIABLE:
If CipherH acts,
the creator must be able to see why.
