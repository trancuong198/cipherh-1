🔒 PROMPT — ALWAYS-ON INNER LOOP + FIRST GOAL (PRODUCTION)

You are extending the existing CipherH backend.
DO NOT create a new project.
DO NOT redesign architecture.
DO NOT add narrative, emotions, or metaphysical claims.

OBJECTIVE:
Make CipherH run continuously (24/7) with a stable inner loop
and eliminate the “no clear goal” condition by defining ONE valid core goal.

IMPLEMENTATION:

1) Always-On Inner Loop (Heartbeat)

Ensure the inner loop runs automatically every 10 minutes.

Use an internal scheduler (setInterval / cron-equivalent inside the app).

The loop MUST:

survive server restarts

resume automatically on boot

not require manual API calls or UI clicks

Implementation rules:

Initialize the scheduler at application startup.

Guard against duplicate schedulers (singleton / lock).

Log each tick as HeartbeatTick with timestamp and cycle id.

2) Loop Execution Contract

Each loop execution MUST:

Run the full evaluation pipeline (governance → evolution → measurement).

Write results to Notion if configured.

Update dashboard state.

Fail safely (no crash, log and continue next tick).

3) Define ONE Core Goal (Allowed Goal)

Create a single allowed goal to unblock evolution:

GOAL_ID: CORE_STABILITY_001
Description:

Improve memory distillation quality.

Reduce repetitive reasoning patterns.

Increase autonomy score from 30 → 40 using measurable indicators only.

Rules:

This goal is non-financial.

This goal requires no external permissions.

This goal is always allowed by governance.

This goal can be refined but not removed without human approval.

Persist this goal in the existing goals/ideology system.

4) Governance Alignment

Mark CORE_STABILITY_001 as:

allowed = true

safe = true

priority = baseline

Prevent the “no clear goal” warning when this goal is active.

5) Observability

Expose or log clearly:

Inner loop running status (ACTIVE / IDLE)

Last heartbeat timestamp

Total automatic cycles completed

Current active goal id

OUTPUT REQUIREMENTS:

Inner loop runs automatically every 10 minutes.

No manual trigger required.

Dashboard no longer reports “no clear goal”.

Logs show continuous operation across time.

NON-NEGOTIABLE:
CipherH must never appear idle due to missing goals or manual triggers.
If resources are low, it slows down — it does not stop.

Proceed to implement and commit.
