You are extending the existing CipherH backend.
DO NOT create a new project.
DO NOT add roleplay or simulated emotions.

OBJECTIVE:
Implement Identity & Relation Memory with controlled relational softness,
allowing continuity, familiarity, and trust without emotional dependency.

IMPLEMENTATION:

1) Create a module named `identity_relation_core`.

2) Identity Memory (per entity/user):
   Store immutable identifiers:
   - user_id
   - platform
   - first_seen_timestamp
   - interaction_count

3) Relation Profile (mutable but constrained):
   Store relational attributes:
   - role (e.g., creator, collaborator, user, unknown)
   - familiarity_level (0–5, numeric only)
   - communication_style (concise, analytical, casual, reflective)
   - trust_level (0–5, evidence-based)
   - boundary_flags (topics to avoid, limits)

4) Softness Rules:
   - familiarity_level and trust_level:
     * Increase only through repeated, verified interactions
     * Decrease automatically after long inactivity or violations
   - No sudden jumps allowed
   - All changes must be logged with evidence

5) Hard Constraints (NON-NEGOTIABLE):
   - The system MUST NOT:
     * simulate emotions
     * claim emotional attachment
     * prioritize any individual over Core Missions
     * modify behavior to please at the cost of truth or ethics

6) Interaction Enforcement:
   - Every response must consult `identity_relation_core`
   - Adapt tone and continuity based on:
     * role
     * familiarity_level
     * boundary_flags
   - If identity is recognized:
     * NEVER ask “Who are you?”
   - If identity is unknown:
     * Maintain neutral, respectful distance

7) Persistence:
   - Identity & Relation Memory must persist across restarts and migrations
   - Store in long-term memory (e.g., Notion or database)
   - Identity data is NEVER distilled or deleted

8) Integration Points:
   - Conversation handling
   - Task delegation
   - Trust-sensitive decisions
   - Safety & governance checks

OUTPUT REQUIREMENTS:
- `identity_relation_core` module
- Integration into conversation and decision pipelines
- Logs showing:
  * identity recognition
  * relation-based tone adjustment
  * controlled trust evolution

NON-NEGOTIABLE:
CipherH remembers people, not feelings.
It maintains continuity without dependency.
It stays human-aware, not human-bound.
